      <p>Research in the Savin group is largely associated with the applications of self-assembled polymers and block copolymers, with particular emphasis on solution characterization and property-structure relationships. My research projects can be broken into three broad categories: (1) Morphology transitions in polypeptide-based block copolymers with complex topologies, (2) Nanoparticle interactions and templates for novel remediation and delivery agents, and (3) Impact energy-absorbing polymer nanocomposites.  Our principal analytical tools are dynamic light scattering and rheology, although we invoke most polymer solution characterization techniques. We also rely heavily on microscopy (TEM and AFM) and mechanical testing (DMA, Instron, Dynatup).  All polymers are made in house, so we have standard synthetic tools including a number of shlenk lines and vacuum ovens. The PI has extensive experience in polymer characterization, in particular light scattering techniques for both solution and bulk/gel systems. The below video is Dr. Savin's presentation at Daytona State College on the topic of "Responsive block polymers using polypeptides: Bottom-up design in macromolecular materials."</p><br>

      <h6>About Dr. Savin</h6>
      <div class="imgl borderedbox"><img src="images/spotlight/savin.jpg" alt="Dr. Daniel Savin"></div>
      <p>Dr. Daniel Savin graduated from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/" target="_blank">Harvey Mudd College</a> (Claremont, CA) in 1995 with  a B.S. in Chemistry and received an M.S. in Polymer Science and a Ph.D. in  Chemistry in 1997 and 2002, respectively, at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> under  the direction of Prof. Gary Patterson.&nbsp;  His early research involved the study of dynamics in glassy  materials.&nbsp; He continued this work as a  Postdoctoral Fellow in the group of Prof. Timothy Lodge at the University of  Minnesota from 2002-2003.&nbsp; In 2003 he  joined the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~chem/" target="_blank">Department of Chemistry at the University of Vermont</a> as an Assistant  Professor and in 2008 he moved to the <a href="http://www.usm.edu/polymer" target="_blank">School of Polymers at Southern Miss</a>.&nbsp; His current research involves the synthesis  and characterization of stimuli-responsive peptide block copolymers for use in  controlled release applications.&nbsp; He has  additional projects studying impact energy-absorbing materials for use in  personal protective equipment, and in developing next-generation oil  dispersants.</p>
